This task I have read carefully whatever mentioned in the assignment. This is the task 1. The problem statement defined here are real world problems we are facing, and this assignment is to give
you a feel of the kind of problems you would be solving, if/when you join. There are some concepts that
would be outside of what you have worked in the past - but thatâ€™s the idea of this assignment. We have not
implemented these solutions ourselves yet (but we have some ideas on how to)
2. That is totally okay if you are not able to solve all of them. The idea is not to see a working solution, but
to discuss the approaches you took, what you learnt in trying to solve.
# Then I have download the Zip file then extract it and opened in the VS Code there are two folder chrome-plugin and backend . 
I have run the task in the terminal and added the chrome extension to see the websocket connection. 
I have just  review the codes and tasks but right now I am as a fresher I have not added any code but if I will get the chance for internship sure I will do my best from previous knowledge and I am eager to learn new technology so I will alos enhance the skills.
